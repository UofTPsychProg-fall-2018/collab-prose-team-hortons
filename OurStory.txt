One day,

I went to school early, eager to find some coffee. 

It was my first day of school so I wasn't sure where I could find a good coffee. It was 6am in the morning and there was nobody I could ask. 

I wandered the empty halls, peeking around corners, and smelling the air for any sign that I could get my caffeine-fix. Then, I heard a sound.

"Ding!" I peered to my right and saw one of the elevators opening their doors. Nobody came out. As if it was waiting for me to step in, I decided to see where this would take me.
